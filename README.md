## App Idea
The existing landscape around cooking recipes revolve around publishing recipes. Users are able to provide an ingredient list and the steps to completing the dish, and others can comment and give the recipe a rating. The focus for our app will instead be about inverting that focus. Instead of publishing recipes and sharing them (outwards), the focus will instead be about the collection of recipes (inwards).

Cooking has grown in importance since the emergence of COVID-19, as people realized that they need to be able to provide sustenance to themselves, as well as the people close to them, without the constant reliance businesses. Cooking could also be a fun hobby that proves to be generally healthier than eating out or fast food. We hope to make the users' journey through cooking enjoyable and personalized.

Recipes that users collect will still be shareable, but we want them to ask themselves what the recipes mean to them with tags. When a user wants something easy and low effort to cook, they can check their collection for recipes tagged with "easy". If they want to try something new or improve their cooking skills, they can look for recipes that are tagged as "not done before". We also want users to be able to edit the recipes that they have collected. The recipes that the users read through and execute may change due to the users own experiences and the availability of ingredients, so we should allow users to edit the ingredients and instructions to make them more personalized. 

Recipes also come from all sorts of sources and mediums. Some come from physical media like cookbooks, while some come from the internet, such as cooking videos and recipes hosted on websites. Having a single place to keep track of all these recipes without having to bounce around would prove very convenient to the cooking experience.
